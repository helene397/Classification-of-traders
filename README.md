# Classification-of-traders

The goal of the challenge is to classify traders within three categories, HFT, non HFT and MIX.

According to the AMF in-house expert-based classification, based on the knowledge that AMF has on the market players, market players are divided into three categories, HFT, MIX and non-HFT.

From a set of behavioural variables based on order and transaction data, the challenger is invited to predict the category to which a given participant belongs.

The proposed classification algorithm will then be applied to other data sources for which market players are currently not well known by the AMF.
